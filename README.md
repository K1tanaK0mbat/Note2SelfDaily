# For the Forgetful Worker 

## Description

The purpose of this website is to provide users with a digital planner that'll save and display what tasks they have to complete throughout their work day. The planner displays the current date and time, with each section of the planner seperated by the hours of a 9-5 pm work day. This is especially helpful for workers like me who find it diificult to manage their time and keeping up with the multiple resonsibilities and tasks of their job as users can update the tasks assigned to each hour and have the ones that are due now or later highlighted. As a result, workers will  worry less about not completing job duties or doing it too late as they now have a visual tool to reference to throughout the work day.

## Usage

For this website, users have to type in the colored text box of each section what tasks they have to complete for each specific hour. Then click the save icon on the end of the box to save your input. There should be a message it was saved. When you refresh, the entry should still be present. To clear your input, delete current text and add your new task. If you want it to stay empty, clear and then click save. The date and time will be visible at the top of the page. Blue= past/before time, Pink= present/ same as time, Purple=future/ after time.
